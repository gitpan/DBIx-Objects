DBIx::Objects
=======================

SYNOPSIS

This module is intended to provide an object-oriented framework for
accessing data sources.  The source of the data is completely abstract,
allowing for complete flexibility for the data back-end.  This module is
NOT intended to provide a persistance layer - please use another module
(like TANGRAMS) if you require object persistance.

For more complete documentation, please check the POD documentation

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDANCIES

This library is not intrinsicly dependant on any non-core modules.
However, libraries which subclass this one, will most likely require
the use of additional libraries, such as DBI.  Additionally, some of
the default methods included make use of DBI, but the library can
install without DBI.
